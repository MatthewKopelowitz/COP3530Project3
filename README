yo guys just download what you need from here and work on it then just upload the changed file when you're done

UPDATE 4/19/21 5:55am
-Bubble and Heap sorts are both done (both work I tested with some plays)
-Python GUI works beautifully, I can't wait for you guys to see it in action
-Plays print out wonderfully, well done @Gates I believe
-Command Line arguments are taken in and then executed properly into variables/maps/etc
-Last thing to do is stratifying function, shouldn't be too horribly hard, I believe @Gates is on that one as well

Good shit bois, let's race to that finish line and ace this shit

ill try to set up branches or at least a different folder to upload into so we can check changes before confirming them to the "final" edition

lmk if you need anything else
