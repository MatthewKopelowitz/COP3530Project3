Hello! Welcome to our COP3530 Project 3!

To run the project, simply run the python program included (proj3.py) in a directory with proj3.out and the 3 .csv files.
Ex: python proj3.py

If this does not work, simply recompile the program with the following command:
g++ proj3.cpp -o proj3.out

NOTE*: the "-o proj3.out" is very important! NOT optional!

Thanks!
